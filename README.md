TuneApp is a simple and intuitive iOS app that helps guitar players tune their instruments. It provides two main modes:
Auto Tune Mode – uses the microphone and pitch detection to analyze the played string and shows whether it needs to be sharpened or flattened with a needle-like visual.
Manual Tune Mode – plays recorded reference tones (E, A, D, G, B, high E) so users can tune by ear.
